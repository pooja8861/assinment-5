# assignment-5
<H1> Loading the required libraries such as numpy (used for numerical phython),pandas,matplotlib
<H2>Using read function we have loaded dataset "weatherconditions1"
<H2>From the data we found mean, median, mode and describe of the following columns given in the dataset that is Temperature,Humidity,Wind Speed (km/h),Visibility (km),Pressure (millibars).
<H2> using the code we extract Boxplot Visualization (Box Plot is the visual representation of the depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles.)
<H2> we also extract scatteredplots for MPG VS Independent Variables (A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that shows the relationship between different variables.)
<H2> We define the X and Y variables and and distribute 20% dataset for test and 80% for training.
<H2> we then import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model and import metrics from sklearn.(The relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable is shown by regression model, by providing a function. Formulating a regression analysis helps you predict the effects of the independent variable on the dependent one!)
